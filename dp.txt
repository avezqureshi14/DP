#DP

//01 KnapSack  Brute Force Approach find all the combinations and find the value of all the combination the maximum value combination will be the best 


How to know it is a DP problem
Count the no. of ways 
Min of all the outputs 
Max  of all the outputs


Whenever use see try all possible ways we use recursion  
Trick
1] Try to represent a problem in terms of index 
2] Do all possiblle stuffs on that index according to problem statement 
3] If question says count all ways -> sum of all stuffs  
    If question says find minimum -> return min of all stuffs and vice versa
